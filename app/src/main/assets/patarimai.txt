BIG TALK is a movement - it's all about skipping small talk to make meaningful connections.

How to start a BIG TALK Conversation

Basic Process:

1. Meet with someone
2. Say hello and introduce yourself first (name, company, school, etc. or find a “small talk” point of entry into the conversation based on the nature of your surroundings). Say you are trying out an experiment/participating in a project about skipping the small talk with new people to ask deeper questions instead...Would they mind trying it out with you for a few moments?
3. Ask the question you have in mind (or that is displayed on your screen) and make sure it employs the three criteria of a Big Talk question (universal, open-ended, meaningful). Be a good listener and ask follow-ups.
4. When you talked everything you wanted about that question, just go to the next one.

Tips:
*When approaching strangers, always approach them from the front where they can see you first - never behind, as that can often feel too unwarranted or surprising. Use your best judgment to only do so in safe and public spaces, such as parks or bus stops.
*Make sure the person does not look preoccupied or busy at the moment. Feel free to start with some small talk. Let them know you are trying out an experiment/playing a game/participating in a project that is about meeting new people and skipping the small talk to have more meaningful conversations.
*Making BIG TALK with strangers usually works best at parties/pre-organized social events. You can use this app as a tool to get you started.
*When asking an initial BIG TALK style question, take time to really listen to the other person's answer. Then feel free to ask follow up questions that deepen your understanding of their distinct and personal experience.
*BIG TALK works well with anybody, from strangers to people you are acquainted with on a surface level, to loved ones. You can ask different types of questions based on the person with whom you are making BIG TALK. For example, you may want to ask coworkers questions related to their dreams, passions, and goals for personal growth. You may want to ask family members questions that have to do with love.

What makes a question "BIG TALK?
*Universal - Any human being could answer it. It doesn't matter what external factors define them.
*Open ended - Elicits more than just a yes/no response. There is the opportunity to hear a story.
*Meaningful - Skips the small talk. Through asking the question, you are able to delve beneath the surface.
